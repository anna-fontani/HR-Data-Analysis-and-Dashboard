# HR Data Analysis and Dashboard
Employees dataset (open source) was preprocessed and used for Power Bi dashboard creation.

## Data Cleaning
A number of corrupt values had to be addressed (like "n.a.", "?", etc.). All these values were converted to NaN. 

Missing values were replaced by mean (salary, bonus) and "No Gender" category for gender feature. 

Records with remaining missing values (first name, senior management, team) were removed for the purpose of this visualization. 

Overall, in real-life scenarios, such records must be treated with attention and their values have to be restored / investigated. 

## Dashboard using Power BI

Power BI was used to create customizable dashboard based on this data. All charts are interactive and can be filtered to display needed information.
